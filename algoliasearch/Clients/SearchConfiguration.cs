* Search API
*
* The Algolia Search API lets you search, configure, and manage your indices and records.  ## Client libraries  Use Algolia's API clients and libraries to reliably integrate Algolia's APIs with your apps. The official API clients are covered by Algolia's [Service Level Agreement](https://www.algolia.com/policies/sla/).  See: [Algolia's ecosystem](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/ecosystem/)  ## Base URLs  The base URLs for requests to the Search API are:  - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}.algolia.net` - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-dsn.algolia.net`.   If your subscription includes a [Distributed Search Network](https://dashboard.algolia.com/infra),   this ensures that requests are sent to servers closest to users.  Both URLs provide high availability by distributing requests with load balancing.  **All requests must use HTTPS.**  ## Retry strategy  To guarantee high availability, implement a retry strategy for all API requests using the URLs of your servers as fallbacks:  - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-1.algolianet.com` - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-2.algolianet.com` - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-3.algolianet.com`  These URLs use a different DNS provider than the primary URLs. You should randomize this list to ensure an even load across the three servers.  All Algolia API clients implement this retry strategy.  ## Authentication  To authenticate your API requests, add these headers:  - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application ID. - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the necessary permissions to make the request.   The required access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in each endpoint's reference.  You can find your application ID and API key in the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account).  ## Request format  Depending on the endpoint, request bodies are either JSON objects or arrays of JSON objects,  ## Parameters  Parameters are passed as query parameters for GET and DELETE requests, and in the request body for POST and PUT requests.  Query parameters must be [URL-encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding). Non-ASCII characters must be UTF-8 encoded. Plus characters (`+`) are interpreted as spaces. Arrays as query parameters must be one of:  - A comma-separated string: `attributesToRetrieve=title,description` - A URL-encoded JSON array: `attributesToRetrieve=%5B%22title%22,%22description%22%D`  ## Response status and errors  The Search API returns JSON responses. Since JSON doesn't guarantee any specific ordering, don't rely on the order of attributes in the API response.  Successful responses return a `2xx` status. Client errors return a `4xx` status. Server errors are indicated by a `5xx` status. Error responses have a `message` property with more information.  ## Version  The current version of the Search API is version 1, as indicated by the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.
